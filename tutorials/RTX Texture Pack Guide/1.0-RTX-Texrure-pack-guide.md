# 1.0 Introduction to Making a Minecraft Texture Pack

![RTX](pbr-guide-img\rtx-prev.webp)


**What is a Texture Pack?**

A texture pack in Minecraft is a collection of files that change the textures of blocks, items, and other elements in the game. Texture packs can drastically alter the look and feel of your Minecraft world, from simple modifications to fully themed transformations.

**Why Create a Texture Pack?**

Creating your own texture pack allows you to personalize your Minecraft experience. Whether you want to enhance the game's visuals, create a new theme, or just experiment with your artistic skills, making a texture pack is a fun and rewarding process.

### Getting Started

**Tools Needed**

1. **Image Editing Software**: You’ll need a program to create and edit your textures. Here are some popular options:
   - Adobe Photoshop
   - GIMP (free and open-source)
   - Paint.net (free)
   - Pixlr.com (web-based)
   
2. **Minecraft Bedrock Edition**: This guide focuses on the Bedrock Edition, but many principles apply to the Java Edition as well.

### Basics of Texture Packs

**Understanding Texture Files**

Minecraft textures are typically 16x16 pixels by default, but you can create higher resolution textures (16x16, 32x32, 64x64, etc.) for more detail. Each texture file corresponds to a specific block or item in the game.

**File Structure**

Your texture pack needs to follow a specific file structure to be recognized by Minecraft. Here’s a simple example of how your texture pack folder might look:

[!file Texture Pack Template](./pbr-guide-img/texture_pack_template_for_bedrock.zip)


```
resource_packs/
    your_texture_pack/
        manifest.json
        pack_icon.png
        textures/
            blocks/
                stone.png
                dirt.png
            items/
                diamond_sword.png
```

- **manifest.json**: This file includes metadata about your texture pack (name, version, description).

[!ref](1.1-manifest-json.md)

- **pack_icon.png**: The icon for your texture pack (usually 256x256 pixels).
- **textures/**: This folder contains all the texture files organized into subfolders like `blocks` and `items`.

### Creating Your Textures

1. **Base Color Map**: This is the main texture that defines the color and appearance of the block or item.

2. **Opacity Map (optional)**: If your texture requires transparency (e.g., glass), you'll need an opacity map, which defines how transparent each pixel is.

3. **Additional Maps for RTX**:
   - **Metallic Map**: Defines which parts of the texture are metallic.
   - **Emissive Map**: Defines which parts of the texture glow.
   - **Roughness Map**: Defines how rough or smooth the texture is.
   - **Normal Map**: Simulates 3D surface details like bumps and dents.
   - **Height Map**: Height maps use grayscale values to indicate how much a pixel should protrude (higher values) or recede (lower values) relative to the surface of a block.

### Packing and Testing

1. **Create the Texture Files**: Use your image editing software to design each texture. Save the files in the appropriate format (usually `.png`).

2. **Organize the Files**: Place your textures in the correct folders within your texture pack directory.

3. **Edit the Manifest**: Update the `manifest.json` file with your texture pack's information.

4. **Load the Texture Pack**:
   - Open Minecraft and go to `Settings`.
   - Navigate to `Global Resources` and click `My Packs`.
   - Activate your texture pack and start a world to see your textures in action.


Creating a texture pack for Minecraft is a creative and engaging way to customize your game. By following this guide, you'll have the foundational knowledge to start designing your textures and bringing your unique vision to Minecraft. Enjoy the process and have fun experimenting with different styles and ideas!
